Code to reproduce the figures demonstrated in the paper.

## Instructions

Folder 'data' contains the ground truth ENF extracted from the power mains and the photodiode signals, which were recorded using the device we developed.

The matrices that hold light intensity information, resulted from the SLIC method are also included to save processings time.

If you want to run the whole procedure from scratch, you can find the video recording dataset and the ENF signals recorded from both sources [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IZZkme26GjhMcxOXbCw56So8LDQyTnLX?usp=sharing)
